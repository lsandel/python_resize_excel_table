# python_resize_excel_table
This python code allows the user to resize an excel table.
With this code one can take a table of x rows and y columns, and receive an output csv file with the same table but in the format x/n rows and y*n columns, where n is user defined.
The command works a lot like the reshape function in matlab, which unfortunately Microsoft doesn't offer on Excel.

Enjoy!
